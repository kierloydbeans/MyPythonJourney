# Python Practice Notes

## Day 1
- Wrote first grade checker
- Input, output, conditional statements
- Learned why repeated variables are annoying

## Day 2
- Added validation for age, year, and grades
- Added comments for clarity
- Nested conditionals felt painful → loops soon
- Time spent: about 1 hour
