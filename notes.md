# Python Practice Notes

## Day 1
- Wrote first grade checker
- Input, output, conditional statements
- Learned why repeated variables are annoying

## Day 2
- Added validation for age, year, and grades
- Added comments for clarity
- Nested conditionals felt painful → loops soon
- Time spent: about 1 hour

## Day 3
- I did this at 1am of Day 4 because I got too busy today.
- Wrote the code from scratch
- Added validation for age, year, and grades
- Nested conditions are starting to annoy me.
- Made a clear summary of the grades.
- Computed the average and its letter equivalent.
- Included the name in the summary.
- Time spent: about 20-30 minutes

## Day 4
- About Conditionals, Input, Validation, and Grading Logic
- Rewrote the code from memory from scratch
- Added isalpha() for name validation to ensure the name variable is alphabet characters.
- Wanted to use isinstance ([grade], int) but it's too painful to implement for each variable. I'll do it when I get to dictionaries and functions. Perhaps it should be a separate method?
- Executed all printing of the summary in one block.
- Time spent: Approximately 28 minutes, 02.2 seconds.
