# Python Practice Notes

## Day 1
- Wrote first grade checker
- Input, output, conditional statements
- Learned why repeated variables are annoying

## Day 2
- Added validation for age, year, and grades
- Added comments for clarity
- Nested conditionals felt painful → loops soon
- **Time spent:** about 1 hour

## Day 3
- I did this at 1am of Day 4 because I got too busy today.
- Wrote the code from scratch
- Added validation for age, year, and grades
- Nested conditions are starting to annoy me.
- Made a clear summary of the grades.
- Computed the average and its letter equivalent.
- Included the name in the summary.
- **Time spent:** about 20-30 minutes

## Day 4
- About Conditionals, Input, Validation, and Grading Logic
- Rewrote the code from memory from scratch
- Added isalpha() for name validation to ensure the name variable is alphabet characters.
- Wanted to use isinstance ([grade], int) but it's too painful to implement for each variable. I'll do it when I get to dictionaries and functions. Perhaps it should be a separate method?
- Executed all printing of the summary in one block.
- **Time spent:** Approximately 28 minutes, 02.2 seconds.

## Day 5
- Focused heavily on input validation and user experience.
- Rewrote the program with stricter checks using is digit() before converting inputs to integers to avoid ugly runtime errors.
- Validated name, age, year level, and all grades step by step.
- Improved the grading logic to handle:
  - passing all subjects
  - passing overall average but failing specific subjects (retakes)
  - completely failing
- Added logic to explicitly list failed subjects instead of giving a vague result.
- This made the program feel more human and less “computer says no.”
- Realized how repetitive validation becomes without loops and functions — pain is now very obvious.
- Occasional Googling, but most of the work was reasoning and logic.
- **Time spent:** Approximately 00:52:45.775.
